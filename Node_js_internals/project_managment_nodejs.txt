# Understanding Project Management in NodeJS

## a. Package Managers

### What is a package manager?

A package manager is a tool that helps developers **install, update, remove, and manage external libraries (packages)** required in a project. These packages contain reusable code written by others, which saves time and effort during development.

**Example:**
Instead of writing authentication logic from scratch, we can install an existing package like `jsonwebtoken` using a package manager.

---

### Why do we need package managers in backend development?

Package managers are important in backend development because:

* They make it easy to reuse code
* They manage project dependencies automatically
* They ensure consistent versions across different environments
* They simplify collaboration between developers

**Example:**
If a Node.js backend needs Express, a package manager downloads and configures it with a single command.

---

### Problems faced if package managers are not used

Without package managers:

* Developers must manually download and manage libraries
* Version conflicts can break the application
* Setting up projects becomes slow and error‑prone
* Team collaboration becomes difficult

---

## b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

### What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the **default package manager for Node.js**. It provides access to thousands of open‑source packages and tools that help build backend applications efficiently.

---

### Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

NPM is important because:

* It installs required packages easily
* It manages project dependencies
* It tracks package versions
* It helps run scripts like start, build, and test

**Example:**

```bash
npm install express
```

This command installs Express and makes it available in the project.

---

### How NPM helps in managing dependencies

NPM:

* Stores dependency details in `package.json`
* Downloads packages into the `node_modules` folder
* Locks exact versions using `package-lock.json`
* Allows updating or removing dependencies easily

---

## c. Backend Project Initialization

### What is the command used to initialize a backend (Node.js) project?

```bash
npm init
```

---

### Explain what `npm init` and `npm init -y` do

#### `npm init`

* Starts an interactive setup
* Asks questions like project name, version, description, author
* Creates a `package.json` file based on answers

#### `npm init -y`

* Skips all questions
* Creates `package.json` with default values
* Faster and commonly used by developers

---

## d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

### package.json

* Acts as the **configuration file** of the project
* Stores project details, dependencies, scripts, and metadata
* Required to install and manage packages

**Why important?**
It defines how the project works and what it depends on.

---

### node_modules

* Contains all installed dependencies
* Automatically created by NPM
* Can become very large in size

**Why important?**
It holds all external libraries needed for the application to run.

---

### package-lock.json

* Stores the **exact versions** of installed packages
* Ensures consistency across different machines

**Why important?**
Prevents bugs caused by version mismatch.

---

### Conclusion

Proper project management using NPM helps create **scalable, maintainable, and collaborative** Node.js backend applications. Understanding these basics is essential for professional backend development.
